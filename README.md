# Usage:  
### Most of the functions can be toggled in .env

### About Status
Use command "/status" to check server status. Including CPU, memory usage and network latency.

### About welcome message:  
Bot would send a **welcome message** to any new user entered the group chat.  
Use "/groupwelcome \<parameter\>" to set welcome message, filter and verification message. Only group admins can change these settings.  
Usages (Also try "/groupwelcome" for usages in chat):  

- Toggle group welcome message:  
  `/groupwelcome <on/off>`  
- Set group welcome message:  
  `/groupwelcome setmsg <message>`  
- Toggle group verify:  
  `/groupwelcome verify <on/off>`  
- Set group verify filter:  
  `/groupwelcome vffilter <regex>`  
- Set group verify message:  
  `/groupwelcome setvfmsg <message>`  
- Set group verify fail message:  
  `/groupwelcome setvffailmsg <message>`  
- Approve all user pending:  
  `/groupwelcome approve`  

In **welcome message**, you can use {new_member_username}, {new_member_first_name} and {and new_member_last_name} in the message.  
Verify message would be sent if verify is enabled.  
After the new user send a message matches the filter by regex, then the bot will send **verify message**.  
If the new user doesn't send it, bot would notify group admin. (Define your own method in notifyAdmin.notify_admin())  
All welcome messages and settings are stored in welcome_msg_config.json.  

### About quotes:
Create a file named "quotes.json" and put quotes like this:
```json
[
    {
        "speaker": "Speaker_Name1",
        "quote": "Quote_Text1"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Speaker_Name2",
        "quote": "Quote_Text2"
    }
]
```
You can also use edit_quotes.py in tools to edit it with an interface.  
If you want to send your customized quote, @bot and type "\>\>\[your content\]". In this way you can send any text "via bot".

### About Êã±ÁÅ´:  
A lot of members in StarLight Tea House are doing such thing:  
Reply a random message with "Áæ°ÊÖï" or react it with "üî•".  
For **every message**, bot would have a probability to do such thing.  
Use "/xmfire <parameter>" to configure this function.  
Usages (Also try "/xmfire" for usages in chat):
- Toggle function:  
  `/xmfire <on/off>`  
- Set probability of triggering the function:  
  `/xmfire set <probability>`  

When the function is triggered, bot would reply "Áæ°ÊÖï"(50%) or react "üî•"(50%) to the message.  
Manual Áæ°ÊÖï and fire reaction are also supported. Use /xm \<message link\> or /fire \<message link\>. Or just reply /xm or /fire to the message.  
You can also use /unxm <message link> or reply /unxm to a message to cancel the reaction.  
~~\[Not finished\] If you think the bot is too annoying, you can use /xmfire suppress <minutes> to suppress it temporarily.~~  

### About sticker file id query:  
Send a sticker to bot in pm. It would return the file id.

### About what to eat today:
Put food names in a file named "foodlist.txt" in config, one food name per line. An example file is provided.
