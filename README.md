# Usage:  
### Most of the functions can be toggled in main()

### About Bot Token:
Create a text file named "bottoken" at the same folder as the script and put your token in it.

### About Status
Use command "/status" to check server status. Including CPU, memory usage and network latency.

### About welcome message:  
Bot would send a **welcome message** to any new user entered the group chat.  
Use "/groupwelcome \<parameter\>" to set welcome message, filter and verification message. Only group admins can change these settings.

/groupwelcome setvfmsg <message> Set group verify message.  
/groupwelcome setvffailmsg <message> Set group verify fail message.  
/groupwelcome approve Approve all user pending.  
In **welcome message**, you can use {new_member_username}, {new_member_first_name} and {and new_member_last_name} in the message.  
Verify message would be sent if verify is enabled.  
After the new user send a message matches the filter by regex, then the bot will send **verify message**.  
If the new user doesn't send it, bot would notify group admin. (Define your own method in notifyAdmin.notify_admin())  
All welcome messages and settings are stored in welcome_msg_config.json.  

### About quotes:
Create a file named "quotes.json" and put quotes like this:
```json
[
    {
        "speaker": "Speaker_Name1",
        "quote": "Quote_Text1"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Speaker_Name2",
        "quote": "Quote_Text2"
    }
]
```
You can also use EditQuotes.py to edit it with an interface.  
If you want to send your customized quote, @bot and type "\>\>\[your content\]". In this way you can send any text "via bot".

### About 拱火:

/xmfire <on/off> Toggle function.  
/xmfire set <probability> Set probability of triggering the function.
